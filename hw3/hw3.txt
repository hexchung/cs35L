assignment 3 homework

QUESTION ONE

- brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because that was
  the line of code that produced the YYYY-MM-DD H:M format in the initial ls
  source file

- technically, it wasn't necessary to delete this line because in the original
  file, there was an if statement that used the case_long_iso_time_style line of
  code but since that if statement was also deleted in the patch, it is
  irrelevant to delete case_long_iso_time_style because it will never be called
  in the new file

QUESTION TWO

- in order to test whether this patch will work in different countries, i
  changed the locale to japanese

$ export LC_ALL='ja_JP.eucjp'

- upon running the modified ls file on ~/Desktop/hw3, the date format showed
  "10??" or "4??" as opposed to the month format "Oct" or "Apr"
- while the program was able to successfully translate the english text to the
  proper month number, the patch should instead have code that defaults to the
  previous long iso time style with the two-field numeric date format for
  locales that are not en_*

QUESTION THREE

- the program outputs error messages from the lines of code in the source file,
  as well as gives an Index Error saying that the list index is out of range
- this occurs because the program was not given any input to randomly choose
  lines of text from, so as it shows in line 261 of the python script, if the
  random generator is not provided input, it will throw an index error  

QUESTION FOUR

- when i run randline.py using python3, the program throws a syntax error in
  line 65 
- this is because while python 2 is able to accept tuples as excpet
  args, that feature was removed in python 3 since automatic unpacking is no
  longer possible 
- this feature was removed in python 3 in order to be more
  explicit and human-readable
