DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL COREUTILS-7.6

- used curl to download the coreutils file
- untar/unzipped with the command $ tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz (x meaning
  extract, z meanig gzip, v meaning verbose, and f meaning file)
- i used the prefix option with ./configure in order to install all of the
  coreutils files into a new directory called coreutilsInstall
- then ran the commands make and make install in order to complete the process

- in order to reproduce the bug, i first attempted to run ls, then ./ls, and
  upon realizing the ls file was in coreutilsInstall/bin, i changed the current
  directory so that i could run the command ./ls -l
- the output did produce the bug in which the date format is YYYY-MM-DD

path for incorrect ls program:
/u/eng/class/classhus/Desktop/hw3/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls

PATCHING PROCESS

- create a new file called patch_file that contains brady's patch content

used command $ patch -p1 < patch_file

- used the pnum option p1 because the files in the patch content have a leading
  a or b and i want to truncate that to just /src/ls.c so that patch can find
  the file in my directory

- in order to show that the *uninstalled* but modified ls works, i ran the
  src/ls file in the coreutils directory (NOT the coreutilsInstall directory)

$ ./src/ls -l

- this successfully showed the date format as "month" "day" "year" (i.e., Sept
  19 2009 instead of YYYY-MM-DD format)

- if i change my directory to coreutilsInstall, i can run /bin/ls -l and it
  still prints the incorrect date format showing that both executables exist
  and the buggy ls was not overwritten

TESTING CORRECT LS

- i want to test a file that has been recently modified vs a file that is at
  least a year old so i create a file using touch -t for the old date and simply
  create a new file for the recent date

$ touch -t 0404201620 oldfile

- in the directory of coreutilsInstall/bin, i can run the ls -l command for my
  hw3 directory which contains recently modified files as well as my file from
  2004 that i created with touch

$ ./ls -l ~/Desktop/hw3

- this command outputs the incorrect date format YYYY-MM-DD

$ ./src/ls -l ~/Desktop/hw3

- if i change the directory to coreutils, then running the src/ls -l command
  also for my hw3 directory shows the correct date format
- however, i do notice that the time stamp does not show for the file from 2004,
  whereas the recently modified files do not show the year, but does show the
  time stamp
